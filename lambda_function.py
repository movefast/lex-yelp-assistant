"""
This sample demonstrates an implementation of the Lex Code Hook Interface
in order to serve a sample bot which manages orders for flowers.
Bot, Intent, and Slot models which are compatible with this sample can be found in the Lex Console
as part of the 'OrderFlowers' template.

For instructions on how to set up and test this bot, as well as additional samples,
visit the Lex Getting Started documentation http://docs.aws.amazon.com/lex/latest/dg/getting-started.html.
